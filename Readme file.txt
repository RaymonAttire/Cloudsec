Assignment 1

Developing the expanded resume website was both a challenging and rewarding experience for me. As I ventured into creating multiple pages and incorporating various web technologies like HTML, forms, JavaScript, and CSS, I encountered several obstacles along the way.

One of the major challenges I faced was organizing the content across three different pages while ensuring consistency in design and user experience. It required careful planning and structuring of each page to maintain coherence throughout the website. Additionally, implementing JavaScript functionality for form validation and dynamic navigation posed its own set of challenges, especially for someone like me who was relatively new to JavaScript programming.

To overcome these challenges, I adopted a systematic approach, breaking down the tasks into smaller, manageable steps. I dedicated time to thoroughly understand the concepts and syntax of JavaScript and CSS, seeking out tutorials and online resources whenever I encountered difficulties. Furthermore, I made ample use of debugging tools to identify and rectify errors in my code, which significantly helped improve the functionality of the website.

Throughout this process, I learned the importance of persistence and perseverance in overcoming obstacles. Each challenge presented an opportunity for growth and learning, and by remaining resilient and resourceful, I was able to successfully navigate through them. Moreover, collaborating with peers and seeking feedback allowed me to gain valuable insights and perspectives, enhancing the overall quality of my website.

Looking back, there are areas where I believe I could have improved or expanded further. For instance, I could have explored more advanced JavaScript techniques to enhance the interactivity and user experience of the website. Additionally, I could have experimented with different design layouts and styles to make the website more visually appealing.

In conclusion, developing the expanded resume website was a valuable learning experience that not only strengthened my technical skills but also taught me valuable lessons in problem-solving, perseverance, and collaboration. Moving forward, I am excited to continue exploring web development and honing my skills further.
